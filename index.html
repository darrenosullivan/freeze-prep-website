    <li><strong>Grab, Mix, Reheat.</strong> Grab the portions you need, mix them up, and reheat for fresh, tasty meals on your schedule.</li>

  <h2>About FreezePrep</h2>
  <p>I created FreezePrep because I was tired of meal prep promising to save time but instead leaving me bored and uninspired. Cooking a giant batch of chicken and rice meant choking down the same bland meal with the same tired sauce for days—and by midweek, I dreaded lunchtime.</p>
  <p>With FreezePrep trays, I could start portioning individual ingredients: veggies, proteins, sauces, carbs—everything. Suddenly, I could mix and match different portions each day and actually look forward to what I was eating. It helped me turn meal prep into a smarter, more sustainable habit.</p>
  <p>Counting calories became simpler, planning my weeks felt organized, and I stopped wasting food. Thanks to the leakproof lid design, I can toss the trays into my work bag, reheat them at the office, and eat better without the mess or stress.</p>
  <p>FreezePrep was designed for busy people who want healthy meals, more variety, and an easier way to stay on track—because meal prep should work for you, not the other way around.</p>
