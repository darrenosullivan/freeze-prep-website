# FreezePrep – Master Your Meal Prep

## Project Overview  
FreezePrep is a simple, clean, one-page website designed to showcase a potential meal prep product — portioned silicone trays that make meal prepping efficient, healthy, and flexible. The site’s goal is to introduce the product, explain how it works, share its benefits, and encourage users to purchase.

## Project Motivation  
I chose this project to explore building a brand around a product in a niche I’m passionate about: meal prep. I discovered an American product called SuperCubes that hasn’t yet launched successfully in Europe. Seeing an opportunity to compete and serve busy, health-conscious Europeans, I created FreezePrep as a concept website to validate and promote this idea. This project allowed me to practice front-end development while thinking like an entrepreneur.

## User Stories  
- As a busy professional, I want easy and quick meal prep solutions, so I can save time during my hectic week.  
- As a health-conscious eater, I want portion-controlled trays to help me manage calories and maintain balanced nutrition.  
- As a beginner in meal prepping, I want clear instructions on how to use the product effectively.  
- As a mobile user, I want the website to be fully responsive and easy to navigate on any device.  
- As a potential buyer, I want a clear call-to-action so I can easily purchase the product.  
- As a curious visitor, I want to understand the story behind the product to feel more connected and confident in my purchase.

## Features  
- Responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for smaller screens.  
- Hero section showcasing the product with a strong headline and clear call-to-action button.  
- “How It Works” section explaining the simple 3-step process to use the trays.  
- About section sharing the product’s story, benefits, and user experience.  
- Footer with copyright and branding information.  
- Purchase page link (currently placeholder for future e-commerce).  
- Smooth scrolling and accessible layout with semantic HTML.

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5 for structure and content.  
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design.  
- JavaScript for toggling the hamburger menu interaction.

## UX Design  
I designed FreezePrep as a single-page scrolling website with clear visual hierarchy and distinct content sections to guide the user naturally through the product story. The colour palette uses soft blues and greens to evoke freshness and health. Wireframes and mockups were created prior to coding to plan layout and responsiveness (see `/assets/wireframes/` folder for images).

## Testing  
- Manually tested responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile using browser developer tools.  
- Verified that all internal navigation links work correctly and smoothly scroll to sections.  
- Ensured keyboard accessibility for the navigation menu, including the hamburger toggle.  
- Checked color contrast and font readability to maintain accessibility standards.

## Deployment
